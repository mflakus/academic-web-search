Academic Web Search (Acaweb) software
Mike Flakus <mflakus@pdx.edu>

Installation:
Academic Web Search requires PHP 4+ (with the yaz extension
installed) and MySQL 4+. To install the necessary MySQL
database structure, you can use the file acaweb.sql in the
/mysql folder to load the necessary tables.
Once the MySQL tables have been created, you can enter the 
authentication information in the file /includes/config.inc.php
for the MySQL server. Additionally, if you have a username and
password for an ebscohost profile, you may also enter that
information in the config.inc.php file. If you would like to 
change the image for the openURL resolver, that image can be
replaced at /img/resolver.gif.
